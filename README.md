# Tuwaiq-Academy-SpringBootCamp-finalProject
For the final project for the SpringBootCamp I have implemented an "Entertainment rating system".

# Entertainment Rating System (ERS):
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a platform where users can rate any entertainment(Anime , Game , Movie) they like. but to be honest the system is a litle biased XD.
The System will allow the users to add/get/update/delete an anime or a game or a movie, also the system can provide the user with the avarage rating for any anime or game or movie, get all animes with a certain number of episodes or less, get all games with a certain game play type, and get all movies with a certain duration or more.
The System has some other fetures like get all animes or games or movies in a certain genre, get an anime or a game or a movie with a certain title, or some other basic features.

#### Tool
The System was built using Java SpringBoot.

*note: some classes were not added to the class diagram for sake of simplicity.*
